This project is an initiative to get students of my university (Southeast University) engaged with problem solving and competitive programming.

This season is online and mostly targeted for beginners. My friends and I have made videos on youtube on different topics, demonstrated simulation using slides. Also we coded and explained every line as we go.

This repository contains my contributions to this project.
