# CS Spree Season 02
This project is to get students of my university (Southeast University) engaged with problem solving and competitive programming.

This season is online and mostly targeted for beginners I have made videos on youtube on different topics, demonstrated simulation using slides I made. Also I coded and explained every line as I go.
